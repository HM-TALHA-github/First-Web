			<h1>IOT Security</h1>
			<hr>
                <p class="parag">The problem with connecting anything and everything to the Internet, is that once you do that, you’re potentially giving hackers hundreds of millions of trapdoors, into our lives, and into industry. There have been the nightmare stories of hackers gaining control of internet-enabled cars, remotely manipulating medical devices, hacking a country’s power grid, and seizing control of web cams for remote spying.</p>

			<p class="parag">With the above in mind, here are seven of the most common IoT threats to expect to either become or remain popular in 2019: </p><br><br>
			 
			 <h3>1. Hijacked Devices Sending Spam Emails</h3><br>
			 <p class="parag">Smart appliances, such as the Samsung Family Hub refrigerator, have the same computing power and functionality of a modern tablet, which means they can be hijacked and turned into email servers. 

In a 2014 investigation by information security research firm Proofpoint, a smart refrigerator was found to have sent thousands of email spam messages without its owners being aware of the problem. </p><br>
			 <h3>2. Hijacked Devices Conscripted Into Botnets</h3><br>
			 <p class="parag">Similar to the aforementioned smart refrigerator sending spam email, IoT devices can be forced to join malicious botnets for the ultimate purpose of conducting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. <br> 

Hackers have targeted baby monitors, streaming boxes, webcams, and even printers to carry out massive DDoS attacks that have crippled domain name system servers.</p><br>
			 <h3>3. The Shodan IoT Search Engine</h3><br>
			 <p class="parag">Since 2009, the Shodan search engine has been revealing quite a few security flaws inherent to IoT. Some of them focus specifically on Australia. <br> 

A hacker familiar with remote management of routers could easily take advantage of common SSH keys to intrude upon a home network and search for unprotected IoT devices. It should be noted that Shodan provides substantial information about unsecured devices. .</p><br>
			 <h3>4. Privacy Leaks</h3><br>
			 <p class="parag">Skilled hackers can cause considerable damage just by identifying an unsecured IoT device that is leaking the internet protocol (IP) address, which can in turn be used to pinpoint residential location. <br> 

Information security experts recommend securing IoT connections by means of virtual private networking (VPN) technology. It’s now possible to encrypt all traffic through your ISP by installing a VPN on your router, and the same functionality isn’t far off for other IoT devices. With the right VPN, you can protect an entire smart home network and keep your IP private</p><br>
			 <h3>5. Unsecured Devices</h3><br>
			 <p class="parag">This threat has been the most insidious since the inception of IoT, and device manufacturers have been partly complicit. <br> 

When IoT devices are shipped to stores with default “admin” usernames and “1234” passwords, consumers cannot be reasonably expected to change and secure the credentials unless the manufacturer insists upon it through instructions and reference materials. </p><br>
			 <h3>6. Home Intrusions</h3><br>
			 <p class="parag">This is the scariest mistake because IoT bridges the virtual space with the physical world.<br> 

hackers can take advantage of this vulnerability by locating residential addresses and selling this information on underground websites to criminal outfits that operate outside the internet. 

This is why securing device credentials and connecting through VPNs is vital to IoT security.</p><br>
			 <h3>7. Remote Vehicle Hijacking</h3><br>
			 <p class="parag">As smart driving cars move from “that would be cool” to near inevitability, the question becomes, how do we prevent these cars from being hacked?<br> 

One can only imagine the consequences of a malicious attacker gaining remote access to your moving vehicle.In the past, the Sync infotainment system, developed through a partnership between Microsoft and the Ford Motor Company, presented a few issues that could have compromised connections.</p><br>
			 <h3>Conclusion</h3><br>
			 <p class="parag">IoT can be forgiven for delusions of grandeur and the conviction that it’s a big deal. The reality is that it IS a big deal and destined to get bigger. 

Unfortunately, the accompanying headaches will get progressively larger as well, unless manufacturers and others associated with this burgeoning industry get serious about security issues.</p>
