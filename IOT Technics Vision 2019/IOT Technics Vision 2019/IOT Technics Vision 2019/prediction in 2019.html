        <h1>What Is IOT (Internet Of Things)</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">1:Growth in Data and Devices</h3>
        <p class="parag" style="margin-top: 30px;">By the end of this year, there will be are around 3.6 billion devices that are actively connected to the Internet and used for daily tasks according to IT Pro. With the introduction of 5G that will open the door for more devices, and data traffic. You can add to this trend the increase adoption of edge computing which will make it easier for business to process data faster and closer to the points of action.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">2:IoT and Digital Transformation</h3>
        <p class="parag" style="margin-top: 30px;">IoT is a key driver of digital transformation in several industries. Sensors, RFID tags, and smart beacons have already started the next industrial revolution. Market analysts predict the number of connected devices in the manufacturing industry will double between 2018 and 2020.
          These devices are a total game changer for the many industries, disrupting every part of the production process from development to supply chain management. Manufacturers will be able to prevent delays, improve production performance. Another example; in 2019; 87% of healthcare organizations will have adopted IoT technology.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">3:More Investments in IoT</h3>
        <p class="parag" style="margin-top: 30px;">IoT’s undisputable impact has and will continue to lure more startup venture capitalists towards highly innovative projects in hardware, software and services. Spending on IoT will hit 1.4 trillion dollars by 2021 according to the International Data Corporation (IDC).IoT is one of the few markets that have the interest of the emerging as well as the traditional venture capitalists. The spread of smart devices and the increasing dependency of customers to do many of their daily tasks using them will add to the excitement of investing in IoT startups.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">4:Expansion of Smart IoT</h3>
        <p class="parag" style="margin-top: 30px;">IoT is all about connectivity and processing, nothing will be a better example than smart cities, but smart cities have been in a bit of a holding pattern recently. Smart sensors around the neighbourhood will record everything from walking routes, shared car use, building occupancy, sewage flow, and temperature choice 24/7 with the goal of creating a place that’s comfortable, convenient, safe, and clean for those who live there. Once the model is perfected, it could be the model for other smart neighbourhoods and eventually smart cities </p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">5:Artificial Intelligence and IoT Data</h3>
        <p class="parag" style="margin-top: 30px;">Artificial intelligence is the fundamental ingredient needed to make sense of the vast amount of data collected these days, and increase its value for the business. AI will help IoT data analysis in the following areas: data preparation, data discovery, visualization of streaming data, time series accuracy of data, predictive and advanced analytics, and real-time geospatial and location (logistical data).</p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">6:Fog Computing & IoT</h3>
        <p class="parag" style="margin-top: 30px;">The benefits of using fog computing are very attractive to IoT solution providers. Some of these benefits allow users minimize latency, conserve network bandwidth, operate reliably with quick decisions, collect and secure a wide range of data, and move data to the best place for processing with better analysis and insights of local data. Microsoft just announced a $5 billion investment in IoT, including fog/edge computing </p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">7:IoT Skills Shortage</h3>
        <p class="parag" style="margin-top: 30px;">While investment in the Internet of Things (IoT) is set to reach over $1 trillion by 2020, according to IDC, the need for IoT skills may just hamper this growth. In fact, according to a Canonical report, 68% of businesses still struggle to hire IoT experts [10]. The latest Tech Cities Job Watch report from Experis showed a 35% increase in the demand for technology skills since this time last year, as businesses look to harness the power of IoT</p>
